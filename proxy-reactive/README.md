# Proxy based reactivity

## Motivation

We're almost at the end of Phase 1 of our evaluation.

This is an attempt at figuring out how a Meteor / Vue-esque reactivity system would feel/behave like. Possibly for phase 2 or later.

### Note

Extremely brittle POC code. There are no guards anywhere. Changing any line might break everything.

### Standing on the shoulders of giants
